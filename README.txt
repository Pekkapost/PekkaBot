This is a personal discord bot I made to run on the server "Another Eden Discord".
The main purpose of this bot is to collect data from a game mechanic named "White Gates".
The bot has a secondary purpose however of being a "gacha" simulator where it rolls units from a "banner" at rates specified from the actual game.
Additionally this bot has also been given a minigame called "Fishing" in which the player can try to obtain better and better fish.
