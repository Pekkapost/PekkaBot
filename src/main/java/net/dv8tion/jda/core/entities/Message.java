/**
 * Represents a Text message received from Discord.
 * <br>This represents messages received from {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.MessageChannel MessageChannels}.
 *
 * <h1>Formattable</h1>
 * This interface extends {@link java.util.Formattable Formattable} and can be used with a {@link java.util.Formatter Formatter}
 * such as used by {@link String#format(String, Object...) String.format(String, Object...)}
 * or {@link java.io.PrintStream#printf(String, Object...) PrintStream.printf(String, Object...)}.
 *
 * <p>This will use {@link #getContent()} rather than {@link Object#toString()}!
 * <br>Supported Features:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Alternative</b>
 *     <br>   - Using {@link #getRawContent()}
 *              (Example: {@code %#s} - uses {@link #getContent()})</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Width/Left-Justification</b>
 *     <br>   - Ensures the size of a format
 *              (Example: {@code %20s} - uses at minimum 20 chars;
 *              {@code %-10s} - uses left-justified padding)</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Precision</b>
 *     <br>   - Cuts the content to the specified size
 *              (replacing last 3 chars with {@code ...}; Example: {@code %.20s})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>More information on formatting syntax can be found in the {@link java.util.Formatter format syntax documentation}!
